## Description
This respository contains the data (i.e., all input palaeo-reconstruciton models, the output data - both preliminary (i.e., during the test phases of the development) and final output) and the Python scripts that associate with the PhD Thesis named "Quantification of palaeo-reconstruction models" by Hoang Anh Tu (Lavie) Ridgway-Nguyen. The main obejctive of this research project is to derive and introduce to a geoscientific community a coherent and semi-automatically workflow to explore any present-day advanced global palaeo-reconstruciton model (also known as a plate tectonic model), extract the kinematic information imbedded in the model, and create kinematic features. Resulting kinematic features include continental amalgamations and plate line kinematic boundaries (i.e., divergent margins, convergent margins, locations of mid-oceanic ridges, pseudo-isochrons, and synthetic oceanic crusts). 
A detailed description of each step (i.e., software tools, specific Python scripts and modules, the input and output data of each step) in the semi-automatic workflow is included in the appendix of each chapter (i.e., from Chapter 2 to Chapter 5) of the thesis document.
